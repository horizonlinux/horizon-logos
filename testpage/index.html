<h1>HTTP Server Test Page</h1>
<p>This page is used to test the proper operation of the HTTP server after it has been installed. If you can read this page it means that this site is working properly. This server is powered by Horizon.</p>
<h2>If you are a member of the general public:</h2>
<p>The website you just visited is either experiencing problems or is undergoing routine maintenance.

If you would like to let the administrators of this website know that you've seen this page instead of the page you expected, you should send them e-mail. In general, mail sent to the name "webmaster" and directed to the website's domain should reach the appropriate person.

For example, if you experienced problems while visiting www.example.com, you should send e-mail to "webmaster@example.com".
Important Note!

The Horizon Project has nothing to do with this website or its content, it just provides the software that makes the website run.

If you have issues with the content of this site, contact the owner of the domain, not the Horizon project. Unless you intended to visit horizon.is-a.dev, the Horizon Project does not have anything to do with this website, the content or the lack of it.

For example, if this website is www.example.com, you would find the owner of the example.com domain at the following WHOIS server: http://www.internic.net/whois.html</p>

<h2>If you are the website administrator:</h2>

<p>You may now add content to the webroot directory. Note that until you do so, people visiting your website will see this page, and not your content.</p>
<h3>For systems using the Apache HTTP Server:</h3>

<p>You may now add content to the directory `/var/www/html/`. Note that until you do so, people visiting your website will see this page, and not your content. To prevent this page from ever being used, follow the instructions in the file `/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf.`</p>
<h3>For systems using NGINX:</h3>

<p>You should now put your content in a location of your choice and edit the root configuration directive in the nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
